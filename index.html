                <h4>Protein Translation</h4>
                <p class="description">
                    Protein translation is the process by which mRNA’s genetic code is used to build a specific chain of amino acids.
                    It is the second major step of the central dogma, coming after transcription, where DNA is transcribed into RNA.
                    Each three-base pair in mRNA encodes either an amino acid or a stop codon (Fig 1). Protein translation involves three major steps:

                        <strong>Initiation:</strong> 
                        Ribosome consists of two subunits, small and large. The small subunit binds to the mRNA at the start codon which is usually AUG. 
                        Once the small subunit is attached to the mRNA, tRNA that carry the respective amino acid, Met, bind to start codon, AUG, via anti-codon binding, AUG-UAC. tRNA’s enter the ribosome at a specific site known as the A site. 
                        To finish ribosomal assembly, the large subunits join the small subunits and are now ready to move along with the mRNA.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Elongation:</strong> 
                        Now that initiation is complete, the ribosome starts to move along the mRNA reading each codon and adding the respective amino acid to the peptide chain in a process known as elongation. 
                        The movement of the ribosome along the mRNA results in more codons being detected by the ribosome. Once a codon is recognized a new tRNA recruits the respective amino acid. This results in tRNA before it shifts to the P site. 
                        During this shift a bond is formed, known as a peptide bond, between the first amino acid and the second one. This shifts the first tRNA to the E site and the second one to the P site. The E site allows tRNA to exit from the ribosome

                    Ribosomes are composed of both RNA and protein, are formed by two interlocking subunits, and contain the sites (A, P, and E) that serve as the functional docking place for tRNA to be read.
                    <br>
                    A site: tRNA enters the ribosome. <br>
                    P site: Peptide bond formation occurs here. <br>
                    E site: tRNA exits the ribosome. <br>
                    They are found in the cytoplasm of a cell or bound to the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and there can be upwards of 10 million per cell. They break apart after completing translation to form a functional amino acid chain.

                <p>
                    tRNA stands for transfer RNA. It is shaped like a four-leaf clover, as pictured. It is typically 76-90 nucleotides in length, and it plays an important role in translation. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    tRNAs act as a bridge that connects mRNA codons to amino acids. They connect through the anticodons that tRNA carries. One end of the tRNA has specific anticodons that bind to the codons on the mRNA, and the other carries the amino acid that corresponds to the codons. From there, the ribosome can connect the amino acids to create a polypeptide chain. 
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    For example, like in the image shown below, the tRNA will contain the inverse, or anti-codons, that are complimentary to the codons on the mRNA strand. It is because they are complimentary that they will bind, and the tRNA will contain the amino acid that corresponds to the codons on the mRNA strand.

                    Although the process of DNA translation is highly efficient and precise, mistakes can often happen, causing mutation. The most common type of mutation is point mutation, where a single base is added, removed, or substituted for another. Substituting nucleotide bases can cause missense mutations, which is when a different amino acid is incorporated into the protein, potentially altering the protein’s function. A silent mutation happens if the substituted base corresponds to the same amino acid as the original DNA. Alternatively, a nonsense mutation can happen if the codon is changed to a stop codon, leading to premature termination of translation and an often non-functional protein. Frameshift mutations are by far the most impactful, and they happen when a base is added or removed. These mutations alter the reading frame of mRNA, changing the entire downstream sequence, and often result in a completely different, non-functional protein.
